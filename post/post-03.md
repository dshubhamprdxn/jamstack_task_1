post_title: Data and digital technologies to improve clinical outcomes for high-risk cardiovascular patients in Australia
description: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for around one quarter of deaths in Australia.1 The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the annual direct and indirect costs of CVD in Australia totals US$12.3bn.2 There are numerous modifiable risk factors for CVD, but the most important include hypertension (high blood pressure), high cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes and obesity.3 While much of the recent focus has been on primary prevention through lifestyle modification, those highrisk patients with existing CVD—such as peripheral artery disease or a previous heart attack or stroke—require particular attention to avoid further morbidity and mortality.
